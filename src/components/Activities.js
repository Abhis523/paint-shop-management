                <h2 >Home Interior Painting: How to Paint Your Walls</h2>

                <p> <br/>If you’re using a custom color for your walls, such as our blue in this example, be sure to dump all your paint into one bucket and mix it. Painting contractors frequently call this “boxing the paint” as this will ensure uniformity.

We begin by “cutting in” the room. Get on your step ladder with your brush and cutting can in hand. Dip your brush in the paint, and rather than wiping the excess paint off on the sides of your can, just give it a little shake – you want to leave a good amount of paint on there. As far as holding the brush, we think its best to hold it as if its a large pencil.

                <p> <br/>Water/Humidity: Paint that’s applied to a damp surface or paint that’s exposed to high humidity can peel easily. Plywood especially can expand and contract depending on humidity levels, making it prone to cracks and flaking in the surface coating.
Lack of Surface Preparation: When your paint surface is dirty or isn’t primed properly it’s prone to cracking and flaking even with a just a thin layer.
Expired or Low-Quality Paint: These paints can peel much more quickly than fresh, high-quality paint.
Improper Application: This is the most common cause of paint failure, especially when wood with an excessive amount of a “flat” hard grain is used.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Choose a Paint Finish</h2>

                <p> <br/>Gloss finish ­is the most light-reflective of any paint choice and is easily washable. Great for wood trim, cabinets and doors.
Semi-gloss finish is somewhat reflective, durable and helpful in areas that need to be cleaned regularly. Great for kitchens, bathrooms, closet doors, trim and utility areas.
Satin finish has just a little shine so it’s easily cleaned. Also great for high-traffic areas like kids’ bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms, entryways and hallways.
Matte and flat finishes absorb the light instead of reflecting it, so they work well on walls with imperfections. Great for bedrooms and any uneven walls, or walls with texture.</p>
