                                <p>
                                    Texture painting gives an extraordinary look to your house. It is a very popular type of paint to cover drywall. The paint has heavy consistency and consists of grains of sand and/or gypsum which is bound by a water-thinned binder. Use of texture paint creates a roughly patterned effect on the wall.

                                <p>
                                    When using emulsion paint on wood, it is important to consider: Emulsion paint is only suitable for interior woodwork. Exterior wooden surfaces require the durability and weather resistance that exterior wood treatment can offer. Preparing the surface when painting wood is crucial.

                                <p>
                                    Waterproof paint is either water-resistant or entirely waterproof and can be used inside the home in bathrooms or basements or used outside the home on objects such as boats, birdbaths or water tanks. It often is made with a latex, oil or concrete base, all of which can provide a strong waterproof seal.

                                <p>
                                    Brushes are ideal for small areas, or areas where more precision painting is needed. Brushes are ideal for trim, corners, and edges. A roller is designed to cover a large area, and hold a lot of paint to cover more area at once. Paint rollers are perfect for walls, ceilings, and any large size surface.
